I am an adjunct professor and a postdoctoral researcher at [Athens University of Economics and Business, Greece](https://aueb.gr/en). 
Before that, I was a visiting scholar at Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy ([Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities](https://vedph.github.io/)), and a senior lecturer (fixed-term) at [Stockholm University, Sweden](https://dsv.su.se/en/).

My research focuses on deep learning for natural language processing and data science for social good.
