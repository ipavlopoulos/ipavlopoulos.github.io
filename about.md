Also, I am an affiliated researcher at [Stockholm University, Sweden](https://dsv.su.se/en/) and [Ritsumeikan University, Japan](http://en.ritsumei.ac.jp/).
I teach as an adjunct professor at two MSc courses of the [Athens University of Economics and Business, Greece](https://aueb.gr/en). 

My research is focused on Machine and Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI applications for social good.
