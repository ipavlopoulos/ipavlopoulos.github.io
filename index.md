I am honoured to serve as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Informatics of [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://aueb.gr/en), with affiliations at [Archimedes/Athena RC](https://www.athenarc.gr/en/archimedes) and [Stockholm University](https://dsv.su.se/en/). 
Previously, I held the position of Senior Lecturer (fixed-term) in NLP and Data Science at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences of [Stockholm University](https://dsv.su.se/en/), and had the privilege of being a visiting scholar at the [Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities](https://vedph.github.io/), Ca' Foscari University of Venice.

My research is dedicated to Machine Learning for NLP, with a keen focus on applications in Digital Humanities, Healthcare, and Sentiment Analysis. I am also proud to contribute as a member of the Editorial Board of the esteemed [magaz√©n International Journal for Digital and Public Humanities.](https://edizionicafoscari.unive.it/en/edizioni4/riviste/magazen/info)
