Previously, I held the position of Senior Lecturer (fixed-term) in NLP and Data Science at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences of [Stockholm University](https://dsv.su.se/en/), and had the privilege of being a visiting scholar at the [Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities](https://vedph.github.io/), Ca' Foscari University of Venice.
